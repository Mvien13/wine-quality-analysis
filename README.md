# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - Data Science Project

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project where I analyze a wine quality dataset and build a model to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties (like acidity, alcohol content, sugar level, etc).

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore and understand how different features affect wine quality and to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a wine is of good or bad quality.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Wine Quality Dataset**, often found on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data about red and white variants of Portuguese wine.

- **Features**: 11 physicochemical attributes (e.g., pH, alcohol, citric acid)
- **Target**: Quality score (0–10)

## 📊 Project Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**  
   Load all required Python libraries for analysis and machine learning.

2. **Loading the Dataset**  
   Read the CSV file using pandas.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, check data types, and prepare the data for modeling.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Use charts and graphs to find patterns and correlations between features.

5. **Model Building**  
   Train a classification model (Random Forest) to predict wine quality.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

7. **Conclusion**  
   Summarize the findings and insights.

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `wine.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Make sure the dataset (`wine.csv`) is in the same folder.
4. Run the cells step by step.
